Made in about 1 hour with basic python :D 


Update: I realized that i forgot to add the code itself, i added only the installer. Fixed it. \
Also optimized the code to be just under 150 lines. 

Update2: I found two bugs with negative values when applying them to bonus on rolling. The result was wrong, fixed.

Update3: I found a bug when applying a bonus roll to need to roll over results. The bonus roll was being applied to 0, instead of the initial roll, causing weird numbers to appear, fixed.
